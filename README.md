# Hangman React & Redux
Hangman Game created with React and Redux

This project was to create the Hangman game using React and I also used Redux to manage the state.

The words are generated using a JSON dictionary file



## Game Rules

The aim of the game is to guess the word correctly by entering one letter at a time.

You get to enter 6 failed attempts, if the word is not guessed before your sixth failed attempt then you lose.

Guess the word without getting 6 incorrect letters and you win!

You can reset the game at any time by clicking the reset button.
